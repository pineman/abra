## TODO

 * Save user name
 * npm all the things!
   * `abra-server`
   * `abra-client`
   * `abra-client-http`
   * `abra-client-cli`

## Ideas
 * CLI client using [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed)
 * Post game chat
 * Room links
 * More stats
 * Autoscroll to visible span
 * Guarantee all sockets start at the same time
 * Sound
 * Submit texts
 * Private rooms
 * Leaderboard
 * Abra stats page or similar (all time words typed, etc.)
 * Text chooser (also language)
 * Various game modes
 * More? Accounts?
